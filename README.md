# Block Buster

A game where the player taps colored blocks to make combos of the same color and score points before the time runs out.

The code is rather messy as it was the first project I had since going totally blind in 2014, and is in Objective-C because I was yet to learn Swift when I wrote it.

I'm not maintaining this anymore since after learning Swift I can't stand Objective-C anymore.
